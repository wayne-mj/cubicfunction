# Cubic function solver

I wrote this to assist my son with his mathematics homework using information from [Cubic Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_equation) and [Quadratic Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation) plus a few Youtube videos that I have lost since then. [^1]

## Running the solver

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

Applying rational root theorem, we can find the roots of the cubic function by finding the roots of the polynomial.

Sample run:
```
./cubic
 
Cubic equation solver
Enter the coefficients of the equation ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

Enter a, b, c, d: 1 -6 9 -4
 Roots:    1.00000000       4.00000000       1.00000000    
 Critical points:   0.160246953      -4.16024685      -2.00000000
```
